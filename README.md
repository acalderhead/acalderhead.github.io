## Approaching Data: A Batman-Inspired Perspective

I am a **Detective**  → I hunt for patterns hidden in the shadows.  
I am a **Strategist** → I develop strategies that shape decisions.  
I am a **Guardian**   → I uphold insights to empower those I serve.

Data surrounds me. Its complexity can be chaotic, full of noise and hidden signals. That chaos demands discipline. From discipline comes vigilance, and vigilance reveals clarity, and clarity builds trust. Trust that guides collaboration, uncovers hidden patterns, and ensures those I serve can act with confidence and understanding.

Amid the complexity, there is beauty, with patterns waiting to be discovered and insights waiting to be illuminated. Curiosity draws me into new domains. Each domain presents new challenges, each challenge reveals opportunities, and each opportunity produces meaning.

I wrangle the chaos and uncover the beauty—through modeling, optimization, and visualization—to deliver insights that teams can act on with confidence.

## Field Notes

EXAMPLES BELOW

### Statistics and Machine Learning
- [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
- [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Bayesian%20Statistics.ipynb) : In this file, I explored how bayesian statistics works and how prior assumption reflects posterior probabilities using Gun control example. 
- [Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/GMM-EM.ipynb): In this file, I implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm to find out true distribution of one dimensional GMM of 2 gaussians.
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): In this file, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms. 
- [Neural Network Implementation](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/NN%20Implementation.ipynb): In this file, I implemented simple neural network using forward propogation, backword propogation and optimization functions to predict the customer churn.
 
### Challenges
- [SQL Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/SQL): This repository contains codes of online SQL challenges (From Hackerrank, Leetcode, Testdome, etc.) solved by me.
- [Data Science Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/DS-Challenges): This repository contains codes of online Data Science challenges (From Hackerrank, TestDome, etc.) solved by me.
